This project is a template for the investigation of Amdahl's law.

In this demonstration, the system speedup is plotted as a function of f and k.

To complete this project, download the source code from GitHub https://github.com/huiannie/Amdahl, and improve on one or more of the following areas:

1. improve the visibility of the graphs (such as through adding a zoom feature or using a log scale) for large input values of k.

2. add a calculator feature that enables the user to enter exact values of f and k to compute S.

3. demonstrate a comparison between Amdahl's law and other alternative models such as Gustafson's law.
